## Thought Proccess

I wanted to create a simple and pretty website, easy to read and to navigate. I added different type of animations libraries to experiment with them. To make it more professional, I opted for a colour scheme that was more muted, but would still reflect my personality. Will be adding more features in the future such as dark mode, more responsive, etc. It currently has a lot of placeholders, since this is mainly the layout of my website. 

### Placeholders included are :
- LinkedIn
- Certificate on About page 
- Projects and its links
- Form

*Hope you enjoyed!*
