## Thought Proccess

I wanted to create a simple, pretty and responsive website, easy to read and to navigate. I added different type of animations libraries to experiment with them. To make it more professional, I opted for a colour scheme that was more muted, but would still reflect my personality.

### Things to work on in the future:
- Contact form implementation
- Projects links missing: Kitty's Tragedy, Cookie Clicker and Pizza Restaurant Website
